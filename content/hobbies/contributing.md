description: I’m not sure if I should call this a hobby, but I’ve noticed that I
  really enjoy sharing my experiences so other people don’t face the same
  difficulties I had. Because of that, I somehow became a local guide 6 on
  Google Maps and an admin of a Facebook group with over 40,000 members. I also
  donate blood every three months and volunteer at the Red Cross whenever I have
  free time. It has become a meaningful and relaxing part of my life.
