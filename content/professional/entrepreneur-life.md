  As an entrepreneur, I managed my products from scratch—from the first idea all
  the way to arriving on store shelves. I handled everything myself, including
  importing, production, marketing, and distribution.


  Achievements:


  Expanded to over 70 outlets nationwide within two years.


  Built a direct customer base of more than 1,100 loyal customers through social media and online markets.


  Maintained strong vendor relationships with suppliers from the USA, China, Thailand, India, Argentina, and Peru.
