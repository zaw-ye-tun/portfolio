title: Journey Across Countries
content: >-
  
  My story is not just about education and work — it’s also a journey across places.

  Myanmar was where I started building my skills and experience.

  Finland became the place where I learned a new lifestyle: calm, focused, and balanced.

  Living here taught me patience, independence, and how to grow at my own pace.

  I’m still learning the language, still adapting, and still improving myself step by step.

  This mix of cultures shaped the way I think and the way I work.
