## Quick Placeholder Option

If you don't have wallpapers yet, you can use solid colors temporarily by:
1. Creating 1920x1080 images with solid colors
2. Using online tools like Canva or Photoshop
3. Light mode: #f5f5f7 (light gray)
4. Dark mode: #1e1e1e (dark gray)

The site will work without wallpapers (will show as solid color backgrounds based on Tailwind classes).
